# Governance

## Purpose of This Document

This document describes how the **Order of the Three Nails** governs itself in practice, particularly as it relates to public repositories, documentation, and shared decision-making.

It complements — and does not replace — the formal governance provisions set forth in the Codex of the Order.

---

## Nature of Governance

Governance within the Order is **voluntary, internal, and limited**. It exists to preserve clarity, continuity, and accountability, not to expand authority.

No governance structure described here claims legal, ecclesial, or civil standing outside the Order.

---

## Authority and Stewardship

Ultimate stewardship of the Order rests with its lawful officers as defined in the Codex. Their authority is exercised as service and custodianship rather than command.

For public repositories and documentation:

* authority is exercised to maintain accuracy and restraint
* stewardship is shared where appropriate
* unilateral action is discouraged except where necessary

---

## Decision-Making

Decisions affecting official documents or representations of the Order follow these principles:

* **Clarity** — changes must be explicit and documented
* **Continuity** — changes may not contradict foundational limits
* **Consensus** — counsel is preferred over unilateral action
* **Record** — decisions affecting documents are recorded

Where disagreement exists, restraint and delay are preferred to haste.

## Maintainers and Contributors

Maintainers are responsible for:

* reviewing proposed changes
* ensuring consistency with the Codex
* rejecting material that introduces overreach or misrepresentation

Contributors are expected to:

* act in good faith
* respect the scope of the Order
* accept correction or rejection without hostility

Contribution does not confer authority.

## Changes to Governance

This governance framework may be refined to address practical needs, provided such refinements do not expand authority or contradict the Order’s foundational limits.

All changes must be recorded and justified.

---

## Transparency

Records of significant decisions affecting the public representation of the Order are to be preserved and made available to members.

Transparency serves trust; secrecy erodes it.

---

## Relationship to Civil Law

All governance activities comply fully with applicable civil law. The Order does not claim exemption, immunity, or special status.

---

## Principle of Restraint

Effective governance is measured not by control, but by restraint. The fewer decisions required, the healthier the structure.

Governance succeeds when it preserves clarity without drawing attention to itself.
