# Security Policy

## Purpose

This document describes how the **Order of the Three Nails** approaches security, safety, and responsible disclosure in relation to its public repositories, documents, and digital presence.

Security within the Order is understood as the protection of persons, integrity, and trust — not secrecy or control.

---

## Scope

This policy applies to:

* public repositories and documentation
* official digital communications of the Order
* symbols, seals, and identifying materials published online

It does not govern personal accounts or unofficial representations.

---

## Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security issue, vulnerability, or misuse related to the Order’s digital presence, you are encouraged to report it responsibly.

Examples include:

* unauthorized modification of official documents
* misuse of symbols, seals, or titles
* impersonation of the Order or its officers
* exposure of sensitive internal information

Reports should be made privately and in good faith.

---

## What to Include in a Report

A responsible report should include:

* a clear description of the issue
* where and how it was observed
* any relevant evidence or references
* steps to reproduce the issue, if applicable

Speculation or public accusation without verification is discouraged.

---

## What Not to Do

Please do not:

* exploit a vulnerability for personal gain
* disclose issues publicly before review
* harass individuals associated with the Order
* misrepresent findings or intent

Security concerns should be handled with restraint and care.

## Handling of Reports

Reports will be reviewed with seriousness and discretion. Where appropriate, corrective action will be taken, and records preserved.

The Order does not guarantee response timelines but commits to good-faith engagement.

---

## Limitations

The Order maintains no classified systems, sensitive infrastructure, or protected networks. Security concerns are therefore limited in scope and impact.

No report should be construed as conferring authority, obligation, or liability beyond voluntary cooperation.

---

## Legal Compliance

All security-related actions comply with applicable civil law. The Order does not claim exemption or special status.

---

## Principle of Restraint

Security serves trust best when it is proportionate and transparent. Excessive secrecy undermines credibility.

The Order therefore favors responsible disclosure, clear correction, and documented resolution.
