# Novitiate and Formation

## Purpose of Formation

Formation within the **Order of the Three Nails** exists to cultivate readiness, clarity of intention, and disciplined habit. It is not a process of indoctrination or testing of loyalty, but a period of learning and discernment for both the novice and the Order.

No one is compelled to advance. Formation serves truth, not recruitment.

## Status of the Novice

A **novice** is one who has been received into probation but has not yet taken vows or been fully admitted to the Order.

During this period, the novice:

* remains free to depart at any time
* holds no rank or authority
* bears no obligation beyond respectful observance

The novice wears a **black mantle without insignia**, signifying humility and incompletion.

## Duration of the Novitiate

The ordinary period of novitiate is **one year**, though it may be extended or shortened according to circumstance and judgment of the Order.

Time alone does not qualify a novice for admission. Readiness is determined by conduct, understanding, and constancy.

## Instruction

Instruction during the novitiate includes:

* the Rule and vows of the Order
* the Four Pillars and their application
* the meaning of symbols, seals, and rites
* basic devotional practice
* expectations of conduct and restraint

Instruction is practical, conversational, and grounded in ordinary life.

## Discipline and Practice

Novices are trained in habits of discipline suited to their station, including:

* regular prayer
* moderation in speech and behavior
* attention to order and punctuality
* obedience to lawful instruction

Where appropriate, novices may also be instructed in **arms, bearing, and posture**, understood symbolically as training in restraint, readiness, and responsibility rather than aggression.

## Assessment and Discernment

Throughout the novitiate, both the novice and the Order engage in discernment.

The Order considers:

* faithfulness to instruction
* ability to accept correction
* consistency of conduct
* suitability for communal discipline

The novice considers:

* willingness to accept restraint
* compatibility of the Rule with ordinary life
* sincerity of vocation

## Admission or Release

At the conclusion of the novitiate, one of three outcomes occurs:

* admission to the Order
* extension of the novitiate
* release without prejudice

Release carries no stigma. It is considered an honest outcome of discernment.

## Spirit of Formation

Formation is governed by patience and truth. The Order prefers fewer faithful members to many uncertain ones.

The aim of formation is not conformity, but steadiness: a readiness to live under rule without illusion or compulsion.
