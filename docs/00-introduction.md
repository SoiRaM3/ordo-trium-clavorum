### Purpose of This Document

It is written to be readable to any interested person, while remaining precise enough to withstand historical, theological, and academic scrutiny.

### What the Order Is

The **Order of the Three Nails** is a **modern Christian neo-chivalric lay order**, founded in the Year of Our Lord **2025**, in **Spain**.

It is:

* **Christian** in faith and devotion
* **Knightly** in form and discipline
* **Lay** in structure, not monastic
* **Modern** in origin, without claim to medieval continuity
* **Symbolic and devotional**, not political or military

The Order exists to cultivate discipline, constancy, charity, and fidelity among its members, under the sign of the **Passion of Christ**.

### What the Order Is Not

For the avoidance of confusion, the Order explicitly does **not** claim to be:

* A sovereign or state-recognized order
* A church, denomination, or ecclesial authority
* A bearer of sacramental or apostolic authority
* A continuation or revival of a medieval knightly order
* A political, militant, or territorial body

Membership confers **no legal status, title, privilege, or authority** outside the internal life of the Order.

---

### Theological Position

The Order stands within **Christian theology**, drawing particularly on **Lutheran tradition**, while consciously employing **pre-Reformation chivalric language and symbolism**.

This is not a contradiction.

Historically, early Lutheranism rejected monastic vows as salvific, not discipline, knighthood, or honour. Accordingly, the Order affirms:

* Justification by faith alone
* The legitimacy of vocation, family, and profession
* Voluntary discipline as moral formation, not a means of salvation

The Order therefore adopts a **knightly rule rather than a monastic one**, allowing members to remain fully embedded in ordinary life.

### The Heraldic and Devotional Center

The central sign of the Order is the **Three Nails of the Crucifixion**.

These are not decorative symbols. They are the theological and moral anchor of the Order, signifying:

* Obedience unto suffering
* Constancy under constraint
* Fidelity without triumphalism

Heraldically, the Order employs a **red cross pattée** charged with **three nails**, governed by traditional rules of heraldry. This visual language is intentional, restrained, and internally regulated to prevent dilution or misuse.

### Lineage and Memory

The Order acknowledges **Nordic ancestry and Lutheran clerical heritage** as part of its historical and cultural memory. This lineage is understood **symbolically and morally**, not juridically.

It grants no authority, legitimacy, or right of command. It serves only as a source of identity, continuity, and responsibility.

### A Living Codex

All documents of the Order derive from the *Codex Ordinis Equitum Trium Clavorum*. The Codex — and this repository — are understood as **living records**. Amendments, clarifications, and additions may occur, but all such changes must be explicit, documented, and publicly traceable.

In this way, the Order binds itself not only by symbol and vow, but by **clarity and restraint**.

## Origin and Foundation of the Order

### Foundation

The **Order of the Three Nails** was founded in the Year of Our Lord **2025**, in **Spain**, arising from Nordic lineage and Lutheran clergy. Its foundation is explicitly modern and self‑aware, making no claim to medieval origin, antiquity, or uninterrupted historical continuity.

The founding act established the Order as a voluntary Christian lay association, dedicated to the cultivation of discipline, service, and fidelity under the sign of the Passion of Christ.

---

### Spiritual Context

The theological character of the Order is Christian, with roots in **Lutheran tradition**. In keeping with early Lutheran thought, the Order affirms:

* The dignity of vocation in the world
* The legitimacy of knighthood and discipline
* The rejection of monastic vows as salvific

Accordingly, the Order’s rule is **knightly rather than monastic**, permitting members to retain family life and profession while living under voluntary discipline.

### The Sign of the Three Nails

The emblem of the Order is a **red cross pattée**, charged with **three nails**, symbolizing the Three Nails of the Crucifixion. This sign is not decorative but theological, serving as a constant reminder of Christ’s obedience, suffering, and steadfastness unto death.

The Great Seal of the Order bears the same sign, encircled by its proper legend, marking acts of internal recognition and memory.

---

### Lineage and Memory

The Order acknowledges a **symbolic and familial memory** drawn from Nordic ancestry and Lutheran clerical heritage. This memory is preserved as cultural and spiritual inheritance only. It confers **no legal, noble, ecclesial, or political authority**, and is invoked solely as a source of moral inspiration and historical consciousness.

---

### Purpose of Foundation

The Order was founded to provide a disciplined framework in which modern Christians may:

* Practice constancy of faith
* Cultivate disciplined service
* Remember the dead and honour the virtuous
* Bind themselves voluntarily to charity and truth

Its foundation is deliberate, restrained, and transparent, rejecting both false antiquity and unchecked innovation.
