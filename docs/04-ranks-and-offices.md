# Ranks and Offices

## Purpose of Structure

The **Order of the Three Nails** maintains ranks and offices to preserve order, clarity of responsibility, and continuity of practice. Structure exists to support discipline and service, not to confer honor for its own sake.

All authority within the Order is **functional and limited**, exercised only within the internal life of the Order and only for the sake of its mission.

   One undergoing probation and instruction, not yet fully admitted.

2. **Servant of Arms (Serviens Armorum)**
   A brother in training, learning discipline, obedience, and ordered conduct.

3. **Companion of the Order (Sodalis Ordinis)**
   A fully admitted member, bound by the Rule and vows.

4. **Knight (Miles Ordinis)**
   A brother invested with greater responsibility and symbolic obligation.

5. **Preceptor (Praeceptor)**
   One entrusted with instruction, discipline, and guidance of others.

6. **House Preceptor (Praeceptor Domus)**
   A Preceptor charged with governance of a local house or chapter.

7. **Grand Master (Magister Ordinis)**
   The senior servant of the Order, entrusted with overall governance.

Ranks are conferred by the Order according to the Rule and may be suspended or revoked for cause.

## Limits of Authority

No rank or office grants authority outside the Order. Titles are internal designations only and carry no legal, ecclesial, or civil standing.

Authority is exercised collegially where possible and personally only where responsibility demands.

---

## Accountability and Removal

Officers are accountable to the Order and may be corrected, suspended, or removed for failure of duty, abuse of authority, or violation of the Rule.

All offices exist for service and may be laid down.

## Spirit of Service

Those who hold rank or office are reminded that their authority is a form of burden. Leadership within the Order is measured by restraint, clarity, and willingness to serve rather than command.
