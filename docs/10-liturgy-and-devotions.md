# Liturgy and Devotions

## Purpose of Devotional Practice

The devotional life of the **Order of the Three Nails** exists to cultivate regularity, remembrance, and humility before God. Its liturgical practices are not sacramental and do not replace participation in the life of the Church. They serve as a rule of prayer ordered to ordinary life.

Devotion within the Order is communal in form and personal in obligation.

## The Rhythm of Prayer

Members of the Order are encouraged to observe a simple daily rhythm of prayer, adapted to their circumstances. This rhythm is intended to be sustainable and non-burdensome.

### Daily Offices

The customary offices are:

* **Morning (Prima)** — Psalm 23 and the Lord’s Prayer
* **Midday (Sexta)** — a reading from Scripture and a short prayer
* **Evening (Completorium)** — Psalm 91 and the Confession

These offices may be observed individually or in common.

## The Prayer of the Order

The Order maintains a proper prayer, recited at gatherings and appropriate occasions. This prayer recalls the Passion of Christ and asks for firmness of faith, charity of heart, and constancy of will.

The prayer is devotional in character and does not claim liturgical authority.

## Feast Days of the Order

The Order observes certain days with particular devotion:

* **The Holy Cross** (14 September)
  In remembrance of the Passion of Christ.

* **The Feast of the Three Nails** (Tuesday after Easter)
  In contemplation of obedience, suffering, and fidelity.

  Remembered as a witness to Christian faith and constancy.

  Observed in gratitude and restraint.

* **Memorial of the Departed Brethren**

These observances do not impose obligation beyond devotion.

## Psalms and Scripture

The Psalms hold a central place in the devotional life of the Order, reflecting endurance, trust, and dependence upon God. Scripture is read plainly, without private revelation or interpretive authority.

Members are encouraged to read Scripture regularly, guided by conscience and pastoral counsel.

## Conduct in Devotion

Devotional practice is marked by:

* sobriety of posture and speech
* simplicity of form
* avoidance of display or affectation

Public devotion should not be used to distinguish oneself or to claim spiritual standing.

## Freedom and Conscience

Participation in the devotions of the Order is encouraged but not coerced. Members remain subject to their own conscience and to the discipline of their respective churches.

The Order binds by invitation and rhythm, not by compulsion.

---

## Aim of Liturgy

The aim of the Order’s liturgical practice is remembrance rather than innovation, steadiness rather than intensity.

In this way, devotion serves discipline, and discipline serves faith.
