# Heraldry and Insignia

## Purpose of Heraldry

The **Order of the Three Nails** employs heraldry and insignia to express identity, continuity, and restraint. These symbols exist to communicate meaning clearly and to bind members to shared responsibility, not to confer status or authority.

All heraldic elements of the Order are governed by explicit rules to prevent misuse, exaggeration, or symbolic drift.

## The Central Emblem

The principal emblem of the Order consists of a **cross pattée gules (red)** charged with **three nails**, traditionally rendered in dark metal.

This emblem signifies:

* the Passion of Christ
* obedience under suffering
* constancy without triumphalism

The emblem is theological before it is decorative. It may not be altered, embellished, or reinterpreted without formal approval.

## Heraldic Description (Blazon)

The arms of the Order are blazoned as:

**Argent, a cross pattée gules charged with three nails sable.**

This blazon governs all official representations of the Order’s arms and banner.

## The Banner of the Order

The banner of the Order bears the arms in full. It serves as a sign of unity and orientation during ceremonial gatherings and formal assemblies.

The banner has no military or territorial significance. It is a symbolic standard only.

## Insignia of Membership

Insignia worn by members reflect rank and office within the Order. These may include:

* mantles of designated color
* crosses or badges bearing the emblem
* seals assigned by office or rank

Insignia are worn only in contexts appropriate to the Order and must never be used for personal display or external representation without authorization.

## Rules of Use

The following rules govern all use of heraldry and insignia:

* symbols may be used only for official or devotional purposes
* no commercial use is permitted
* insignia may not be modified or combined with other symbols
* use by non-members is prohibited without consent

Violation of these rules constitutes a breach of discipline.

## Relationship to Family and Historical Arms

The Order acknowledges that similar symbols, including the motif of **three nails**, appear in historical family arms and devotional art. Such resemblance reflects symbolic continuity rather than juridical inheritance.

No family arms are claimed as arms of the Order, and no heraldic right is asserted beyond the Order’s own defined emblems.

## Custody and Oversight

Oversight of heraldry and insignia rests with the **Keeper of the Nails**, who ensures correct usage, preservation of meaning, and adherence to the Rule.

All official designs, reproductions, and adaptations must be reviewed and approved.

## Principle of Restraint

The Order affirms that symbols gain strength through restraint. Heraldry is to be clear, sober, and limited, so that meaning remains stable and credible.

In this way, the insignia of the Order serve memory and discipline rather than spectacle.
