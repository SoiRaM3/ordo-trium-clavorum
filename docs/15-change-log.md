# Change Log

## Purpose of the Change Log

The **Change Log** exists to preserve transparency, continuity, and accountability within the **Order of the Three Nails**. As the Order understands its documents to be living records, all substantive changes must be openly recorded.

This log prevents silent revision, mythic drift, and retrospective reinterpretation.

## Principles Governing Change

All changes to the documents of the Order are governed by the following principles:

* **Clarity** — changes must be explicit and intelligible
* **Continuity** — changes may refine, but not contradict, founding limits
* **Restraint** — expansion of authority or symbolism is prohibited
* **Traceability** — prior versions remain historically visible

No change may retroactively alter the modern founding of the Order or its stated limitations.

## Categories of Change

Changes are recorded under the following categories:

* **Editorial** — corrections of language, formatting, or clarity without change of meaning
* **Clarificatory** — explanations added to prevent misunderstanding
* **Procedural** — adjustments to practice consistent with the Rule
* **Doctrinal** — rare and limited refinements requiring full justification

Each entry must state its category.

## Required Elements of an Entry

Each entry in this Change Log must include:

* date of change
* document(s) affected
* nature of the change
* reason for the change
* authority approving the change

Unsigned or undocumented changes are invalid.

## Initial Entry

**2025 — Foundation**

* Establishment of the Order of the Three Nails
* Promulgation of the initial Codex and core documents
* Affirmation of modern origin, voluntary association, and defined limitations

This entry serves as the fixed point from which all future changes are measured.

## Method of Recording

All changes are to be recorded in this file and reflected in version-controlled repositories where applicable. Earlier versions must remain accessible for reference.

---

## Authority and Review

Changes are proposed through the Chapter and confirmed according to the governance of the Order. No individual may unilaterally revise foundational documents.

---

## Aim of the Change Log

The aim of this Change Log is not bureaucratic control, but **fidelity over time**. By recording change honestly, the Order protects itself from illusion, improvisation, and erosion of purpose.

Continuity is preserved not by immobility, but by truthful record.
