# Rule and Vows

## Nature of the Rule

The **Rule of the Order of the Three Nails** is **knightly rather than monastic**. It is a rule of discipline, conduct, and orientation, not a path to salvation. Membership in the Order does not replace baptism, faith, or participation in the life of the Church.

The Rule exists to give **form and restraint** to a voluntary commitment, so that devotion may be practiced with constancy rather than impulse.

## Theological Boundary

In accordance with **Lutheran Christian theology**, the Order affirms:

* justification by faith alone
* salvation as the work of God, not of vows or discipline
* vocation in ordinary life as a legitimate and holy calling

Accordingly, the Rule explicitly rejects the idea that obedience, discipline, or membership confer spiritual merit or salvific grace.

The Rule binds the conscience only insofar as it is freely accepted.

## The Four Pillars

All members of the Order are bound by the **Four Pillars**, which constitute the moral foundation of the Rule:

1. **Fideliter** — Faithfully
   To remain steadfast in Christian faith and confession, without dissimulation or cowardice.

2. **Fortiter** — Bravely
   To endure hardship, resistance, and suffering with constancy and restraint.

3. **Caritative** — Charitably
   To act toward others with mercy, generosity, and ordered love.

4. **Simpliciter** — Simply
   To live without excess, false display, or affectation, speaking truth plainly.

These pillars govern conduct both within and outside the Order.

## The Vows

Members of the Order take **simple vows**, understood as promises of discipline rather than sacred bonds. The vows are:

* **Obedience** — to the Rule and lawful superiors of the Order
* **Discipline** — of conduct, speech, and habit
* **Charity** — toward the poor, the brethren, and those in need
* **Constancy** — in commitment, even when enthusiasm fades

These vows are moral commitments, not sacramental acts. They may be dispensed or released according to the Rule.

## Family, Vocation, and Property

The Rule permits and affirms:

* marriage and family life
* lawful profession and employment
* private property and civic responsibility

No member is required to withdraw from the world. The Order recognizes ordinary life as the primary field of Christian obedience.

## Conduct and Speech

Members are expected to:

* speak truthfully and plainly
* avoid unnecessary contention
* reconcile disputes without delay
* maintain sobriety and moderation

Conduct reflects not honor alone, but responsibility toward others.

## Authority and Discipline

Authority within the Order exists solely for the sake of order and discipline. Offices are burdens of service, not marks of privilege.

Discipline is corrective, not punitive. It aims at restoration, clarity, and continued faithfulness.

## Freedom and Departure

Membership in the Order is voluntary. A member may depart freely, and release from vows shall not be hindered.

The Rule binds only those who choose to remain under it.

## Purpose of the Rule

The Rule exists to make faith **durable**, charity **ordered**, and commitment **enduring**. It does not seek perfection, but steadiness.

In this way, the Rule serves the mission of the Order without becoming its mas
