# Seals and Sigillography

## Purpose of Seals

Within the **Order of the Three Nails**, seals serve as marks of recognition, authentication, and memory. They do not convey legal force outside the Order and are not instruments of civil, ecclesial, or sovereign authority.

Seals exist to confirm internal acts, preserve continuity, and bind responsibility to office.

## The Great Seal of the Order

### Description

The **Great Seal** (*Magnum Sigillum*) is circular in form and bears the central emblem of the Order: the cross pattée charged with three nails, surrounded by the proper legend of the Order.

### Function

The Great Seal:

* authenticates official acts of the Order
* confirms appointments and offices
* ratifies internal documents

Custody of the Great Seal rests with the **Grand Master**, who bears responsibility for its proper use.

## Seals of Office and Rank

Each principal office and rank within the Order is assigned its own seal, subordinate to the Great Seal.

### Purpose

Seals of office:

* identify responsibility and duty
* distinguish function, not honor
* operate only under confirmation of the Great Seal

They may be used only by the holder of the office and only for acts pertaining to that office.

## The Memorial Seal

### Meaning

The **Memorial Seal** is reserved for the remembrance of deceased brethren. It signifies fellowship that endures beyond death and the completion of earthly obligation.

### Use

The Memorial Seal is impressed in the **Roll of the Dead** at the death of a brother. The personal seal of the deceased is broken, marking the end of all office and rank.

## Rules Governing Seals

The following rules apply to all seals of the Order:

* seals are used only for internal purposes
* no seal may be reproduced without authorization
* seals may not be used for commercial, political, or personal gain
* misuse of a seal constitutes a serious breach of discipline

## Custody and Oversight

Oversight of seals and sigillography belongs to the **Keeper of the Nails**, who maintains the seals, records their use, and ensures adherence to the Rule.

The Keeper acts under the authority of the Grand Master and is accountable to the Chapter.

## Historical and Symbolic Context

The Order recognizes the historical use of seals in medieval and early modern institutions. Its own use of seals is **symbolic and organizational**, not juridical.

Seals are employed as instruments of memory and order, not as claims to inherited authority.

## Principle of Limitation

The power of a seal lies in restraint. When used sparingly and clearly, it preserves meaning; when multiplied or exaggerated, it corrodes trust.

The Order therefore binds itself to limited and accountable use of all seals.
