# Virtues and Discipline

## Purpose of Virtue

The **Order of the Three Nails** understands virtue not as personal distinction, but as **habituated fidelity**. Virtue is cultivated through repetition, restraint, and accountability, so that faith may endure beyond inclination or mood.

Discipline serves virtue by giving it form. Without discipline, virtue dissolves into sentiment.

## The Four Pillars

The moral life of the Order is governed by the **Four Pillars**, which bind belief to conduct and intention to action.

### Fideliter — Faithfully

To live faithfully is to remain steadfast in Christian confession and trust in God, without concealment or opportunism. Faithfulness requires constancy in prayer, honesty in speech, and integrity in conduct.

The right hand, fixed by the nail, signifies commitment that does not withdraw when tested.

### Fortiter — Bravely

Bravery within the Order is not recklessness or aggression, but endurance under trial. To live bravely is to remain firm when facing resistance, suffering, or fear, without surrender to bitterness or despair.

The left hand, strengthened in adversity, signifies constancy rather than force.

### Caritative — Charitably

Charity is the ordered love of neighbor expressed through mercy, generosity, and service. Members are expected to give of time, attention, and resources according to ability, without display or expectation of return.

The heart, armed with mercy, signifies compassion governed by wisdom.

### Simpliciter — Simply

Simplicity governs speech, habit, and manner of life. Members are called to avoid excess, vanity, and false display, choosing clarity over ornament and truth over impression.

The feet, set in truth, signify a life directed without duplicity.

## Discipline of Life

Discipline within the Order is practical and attainable. It includes:

* regular prayer and devotional practice
* moderation in food, drink, and habit
* sobriety of speech and conduct
* faithful observance of the Rule

Discipline is adapted to the circumstances of ordinary life and does not require withdrawal from family or profession.

## Correction and Accountability

Members are subject to fraternal correction when conduct departs from the Rule. Correction is intended to restore clarity and faithfulness, not to punish or humiliate.

Persistent disregard for discipline may result in suspension or removal, according to the judgment of the Order.

## Strength Through Restraint

The Order teaches that strength is preserved through restraint. Authority without restraint corrupts; discipline without charity hardens.

Virtue is therefore measured not by intensity, but by endurance.

---

## Aim of Discipline

The aim of discipline is not perfection, but **steadiness**: a life capable of bearing responsibility, suffering, and service without collapse.

In this way, virtue is not displayed, but lived.
