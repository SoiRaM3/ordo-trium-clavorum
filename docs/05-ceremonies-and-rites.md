# Ceremonies and Rites

## Purpose of Ceremonies

The ceremonies of the **Order of the Three Nails** exist to give visible form to inward commitment. They are not sacraments and do not confer grace. Their purpose is symbolic, pedagogical, and communal: to mark transitions, reinforce discipline, and preserve memory.

All rites are conducted with sobriety and restraint. No ceremony is secret, coercive, or theatrical in nature.

## Reception of a Novice

### Meaning

The reception of a novice marks the beginning of formal formation within the Order. It signifies willingness to learn obedience, discipline, and service.

### Rite

The novice is led to the threshold of the Order and clothed in a **black mantle without insignia**, signifying humility and probation. A small **key** is placed in his hand with the words:

> *“Enter, and learn to serve.”*

The novice is enrolled for a period of probation, during which he is instructed in the Rule, virtues, and discipline of the Order.

## Investiture of a Brother or Knight

### Meaning

Investiture marks full admission to the Order and acceptance of its vows and obligations. It signifies readiness for responsibility rather than elevation in honor.

### Rite

During investiture:

* a **sword** is laid upon the cross as a sign of restraint and ordered strength
* a **white mantle bearing the red cross** is placed upon the brother
* the vows are affirmed publicly

A blessing of arms may be spoken, invoking their use only for defence, service, and charity.

The funeral rite honors a deceased brother and affirms fellowship beyond death.

### Rite

At the funeral of a brother:

* the **mantle and arms** are placed upon the bier

## Memorial Observances

The Order maintains days of remembrance for its founder and departed brethren. These observances reinforce continuity, humility, and gratitude rather than veneration of persons.

## Conduct of Rites

All ceremonies are conducted in accordance with the Rule and under the oversight of lawful officers. No rite may be altered or expanded in meaning without clear documentation and approval.

Rites bind by meaning and consent, not by compulsion.
