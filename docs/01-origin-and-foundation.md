# Origin and Foundation

## Founding Act

The **Order of the Three Nails** (*Ordo Equitum Trium Clavorum*) was founded in the **Year of Our Lord 2025**, in **Spain**. Its establishment is explicit, modern, and deliberate. The Order makes no claim to medieval origin, uninterrupted survival, or juridical continuity with any historical knightly institution.

The founding act constituted the Order as a **voluntary Christian lay association**, ordered by its own rule and discipline, and bound only by conscience, faith, and freely accepted obligation.

## Geographic Context

The Order was founded in Spain, a land historically shaped by the convergence of classical inheritance, Christian tradition, and medieval memory. This context is acknowledged as formative but not determinative. The Order does not claim national character, territorial mandate, or political allegiance.

Its presence in Spain reflects circumstance and vocation rather than inheritance or authority.

## Ecclesial and Spiritual Context

The Order arose from a background of **Lutheran clerical formation** and Christian lay life. It does not constitute a church, denomination, or ministry, and it exercises **no sacramental or ecclesial authority**.

In accordance with Lutheran theology:

* discipline is formative, not salvific
* vows are voluntary, not redemptive
* vocation in ordinary life is affirmed, not renounced

For this reason, the Order adopts a **knightly rule rather than a monastic one**, permitting its members to retain family life, profession, and civic responsibility.

## Foundational Symbol

From its inception, the Order was placed under the sign of the **Three Nails of the Passion of Christ**. This symbol was chosen deliberately as the theological and moral center of the Order.

The Three Nails signify:

* obedience under suffering
* constancy without domination
* fidelity without triumphalism

They orient the Order away from conquest and toward restraint, service, and endurance.

## Lineage, Memory, and Limits

The founders acknowledge **Nordic ancestry and Lutheran clerical heritage** as part of their historical memory. This lineage is understood as **cultural and moral inheritance only**.

No legal, noble, ecclesial, or political authority is derived from ancestry. Memory is preserved to cultivate responsibility, humility, and continuity of conscience.

## Intent of Foundation

The Order was founded to provide a disciplined framework in which modern Christians may:

* practice constancy of faith
* cultivate ordered charity and service
* preserve communal memory of the dead
* live symbolically without illusion of power

Its foundation is marked by **deliberate limitation**: a rejection of false antiquity, a refusal of coercive authority, and a commitment to clarity and restraint.

## Permanence and Accountability

The fact of the Order’s foundation is fixed in time and place. While its documents, practices, and expressions may be refined, its modern origin and defined limits are permanent.

All future developments must remain faithful to this founding clarity and be openly recorded as part of the living documentary record of the Order.
