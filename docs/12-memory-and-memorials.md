# Memory and Memorials

## Purpose of Memory

The **Order of the Three Nails** preserves memory as an act of gratitude, humility, and continuity. Remembrance within the Order is not veneration of persons, but acknowledgment of fidelity, sacrifice, and responsibility across time.

Memory binds the living to the dead without granting authority to the past.

## The Roll of the Dead

The Order maintains a **Roll of the Dead**, in which the names of deceased brethren are inscribed. Entry into the Roll signifies the completion of earthly obligation and continued remembrance within the fellowship of the Order.

At the death of a brother:

* his name is entered into the Roll of the Dead
* his personal seal is broken
* all offices and ranks held by him cease

The Roll is a record of memory, not of succession.

## The Memorial Seal

The **Memorial Seal** is reserved exclusively for acts of remembrance. It is impressed in the Roll of the Dead and in documents pertaining to memorial observances.

The Memorial Seal signifies fellowship beyond death without implying ongoing authority, intercession, or sanctity.

## Days of Remembrance

The Order observes specific days of remembrance, including:

* the Memorial of the Founder
* the Memorial of the Departed Brethren

These observances are marked by prayer, silence, and restraint. They do not impose obligation beyond devotion.

## Historical Figures in Memory

The Order records certain historical figures in its memory as witnesses of vocation, courage, or fidelity. Such remembrance is descriptive, not exemplary in the sense of command.

Figures remembered within the Order may include:

* clergy noted for faithfulness and learning
* lay persons noted for courage, service, or endurance

Their inclusion affirms continuity of human responsibility, not inheritance of authority.

## Limits of Remembrance

Remembrance within the Order does not entail:

* invocation of the dead
* claims of spiritual mediation
* transmission of office or authority
* establishment of cult or veneration

The dead are remembered with gratitude and released from obligation.

## Custody of Memory

Custody of the Roll of the Dead and Memorial Seal rests with the **Keeper of the Nails**, under oversight of the Chapter.

Records of memory are to be preserved with care, accuracy, and restraint.

## Aim of Memorial Practice

The aim of memorial practice is sobriety of conscience. By remembering those who came before, the living are reminded of the limits of power, the certainty of death, and the enduring demand of faithfulness.

Memory thus serves discipline rather than sentiment.
