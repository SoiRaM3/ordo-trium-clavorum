# Mission and Scope

## Mission

The mission of the **Order of the Three Nails** is to cultivate a disciplined Christian life marked by constancy, charity, and faithful endurance, under the sign of the **Passion of Christ**.

The Order exists to provide a structured, symbolic, and voluntary framework in which its members may:

* deepen personal faith and moral responsibility
* practice disciplined service toward others
* cultivate constancy in vocation, trial, and ordinary life
* preserve memory, restraint, and reverence in a fragmented age

The mission of the Order is inwardly formative and outwardly charitable. It seeks not conquest or recognition, but steadiness, service, and moral clarity.

## Spiritual Orientation

The spiritual center of the Order is the **Three Nails of the Crucifixion**, understood as signs of obedience, suffering, and fidelity unto death. All practices, disciplines, and symbols of the Order are oriented toward contemplation of the Passion and imitation of Christ’s steadfastness.

The Order rejects triumphalism and domination as incompatible with its devotional focus. Strength is understood not as mastery over others, but as endurance, restraint, and willingness to bear responsibility.

## Scope of Activity

The activities of the Order are intentionally limited in scope. They include:

* devotional practice and prayer
* moral and disciplinary formation
* charitable service and aid to the needy
* preservation of communal memory and tradition
* symbolic and ceremonial observance

The Order does not conduct military operations, exercise coercive authority, or claim jurisdiction beyond its own internal life.

## Boundaries and Exclusions

For clarity and accountability, the Order explicitly excludes itself from the following domains:

* political advocacy or party affiliation
* territorial, sovereign, or governmental claims
* ecclesial governance or sacramental ministry
* compulsory authority over non-members
* commercial exploitation of titles or symbols

Participation in the Order is voluntary, and departure incurs no penalty beyond loss of membership.

## Relationship to the World

Members of the Order remain fully engaged in ordinary life. Family, profession, civic responsibility, and lawful allegiance are affirmed as proper Christian vocations.

The Order does not withdraw members from society, nor does it seek to replace existing institutions. It functions as a complementary discipline, not a parallel authority.

## Measure of Faithfulness

The faithfulness of the Order is not measured by growth, influence, or recognition, but by:

* consistency of discipline
* integrity of conduct
* clarity of limits
* fidelity to its founding mission

In this way, the scope of the Order remains intentionally narrow, so that its mission may remain clear.
