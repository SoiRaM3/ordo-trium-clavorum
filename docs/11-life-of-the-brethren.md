# Life of the Brethren

## Ordinary Life as Vocation

The **Order of the Three Nails** affirms ordinary life as the primary field of Christian obedience. Membership in the Order does not remove a brother from society, but calls him to live with greater clarity, restraint, and responsibility within it.

Family, work, and civic duty are not secondary to the life of the Order; they are integral to it.

## Family and Household

A brother may marry and raise a family according to his vocation and conscience. The Order does not impose celibacy or separation from household life.

Within the family, a brother is expected to:

* act with patience and fidelity
* exercise authority without domination
* cultivate peace and stability

The family of a brother may share in the goodwill and blessing of the Order, but bears no obligation to it.

## Work and Profession

Brothers are encouraged to pursue lawful professions and honest labor. Work is understood as service, provision, and participation in the common good.

A brother should:

* perform his work with diligence and integrity
* avoid professions that require deception, cruelty, or injustice
* conduct himself honorably in all dealings

The Order does not provide livelihood, nor does it interfere with professional judgment.

## Conduct and Reputation

A brother is expected to guard his conduct so that neither his own name nor the name of the Order is brought into disrepute.

This includes:

* truthfulness in speech
* restraint in public behavior
* avoidance of needless quarrels
* respect toward lawful authority

Public distinction is neither sought nor encouraged.

## Table, Drink, and Habit

Moderation governs the daily habits of the brethren.

Brothers are instructed to:

* eat with temperance
* drink without excess
* avoid drunkenness and addiction

Food, drink, and habit are to serve health and fellowship, not indulgence or display.

## Companionship and Fellowship

The brethren are encouraged to maintain bonds of mutual support and honest counsel. Fellowship within the Order is marked by:

* loyalty without blind allegiance
* correction without humiliation
* solidarity without exclusivity

Private disputes are to be resolved quietly and promptly.

## Bearing and Presence

A brother should conduct himself with quiet dignity. Bearing is neither theatrical nor severe, but composed and attentive.

The Order does not prescribe uniform behavior in public life, but expects members to act with awareness that they represent their commitments.

## Aim of the Common Life

The aim of the life of the brethren is not withdrawal, distinction, or recognition, but **steadiness**: a life capable of sustaining faith, service, and responsibility over time.

In this way, the Order seeks to form men whose ordinary lives bear the mark of discipline rather than display.
