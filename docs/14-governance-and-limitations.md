# Governance and Limitations

## Purpose of Governance

The **Order of the Three Nails** is governed to preserve clarity, restraint, and accountability. Governance exists to serve the mission and Rule of the Order, not to expand power or authority.

All structures of governance are internal, voluntary, and limited by design.

## Nature of Authority

Authority within the Order is **functional rather than sovereign**. It arises from freely accepted responsibility and exists only within the internal life of the Order.

No authority exercised by the Order extends beyond its members or carries legal, ecclesial, or civil force.

## Governing Bodies

### The Chapter

The **Chapter** is the ordinary deliberative body of the Order. It provides counsel, oversight, and collective judgment in matters of discipline, interpretation of the Rule, and continuity of practice.

The Chapter does not legislate independently of the Rule, nor may it override the defined limits of the Order.

### The Grand Master

The **Grand Master** serves as the chief steward of the Order’s governance. His authority is exercised in service, coordination, and guardianship of the Rule.

The Grand Master:

* presides over the Chapter
* ensures fidelity to the mission and limits of the Order
* represents the Order only in matters expressly permitted by the Rule

He may not claim personal authority beyond his office, nor act contrary to the Rule.

## Decision-Making

Decisions within the Order are made with preference for counsel, clarity, and consensus. Where authority must be exercised, it is to be done sparingly and with explanation.

No decision may contradict the founding principles, mission, or stated limitations of the Order.

## Limitations of Power

The Order explicitly denies itself the following powers:

* sovereignty or statehood
* political authority or advocacy
* territorial jurisdiction
* judicial or coercive power
* ecclesial or sacramental authority

The Order may not act as a substitute for church, state, or civil society.

## Legal Status

The Order exists as a voluntary association. It claims no special legal recognition, immunity, or privilege by virtue of its name, symbols, or internal offices.

Any legal presence required for practical matters (such as administration or charity) must comply fully with applicable civil law.

---

## Transparency and Accountability

Governance of the Order is subject to transparency appropriate to its size and scope. Records of decisions, changes to documents, and significant actions are to be preserved and made accessible to members.

Abuse of authority constitutes a grave violation of the Rule.

---

## Amendment and Continuity

Documents of governance may be amended only with clear justification, recorded deliberation, and explicit acknowledgment of change.

No amendment may remove or weaken the fundamental limitations established at the foundation of the Order.

---

## Principle of Restraint

The legitimacy of the Order rests not on power, but on restraint. Governance is successful only insofar as it prevents excess, guards humility, and preserves trust.

In this way, limitation itself becomes a form of discipline.
